Traditional 3D audio systems are often used to enhance the experience of movies
and games. Their popularity has risen as more entertainment centers and theaters
are outfitted with multiple speakers to provide a more immersive experience for
content. The use of this technology has been explored in the context of user
interface design but has not been implemented in any mainstream accessible user
interfaces.

This paper explores previously researched conceptual models of binaural audio
interfaces and intelligent agent designs. The goal is integrate the theory
behind intelligent notification systems and positional audio  to assist users in
multi-tasking environment. This paper demonstrates that the interplay of systems
offers the potential of increased productivity, smoother transitions, and a more
fluid user experience.
